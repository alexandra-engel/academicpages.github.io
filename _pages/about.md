My name is Alexandra Engel. I am a scientific librarian in training at the university library of the University of Konstanz. Before immersing myself into the world of libraries, I was a doctoral researcher at KU Leuven where I was part of the <a href="https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl">Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics</a> research group (short: QLVL) at KU Leuven working in the field of cognitive sociolinguistics under the supervision of Benedikt Szmrecsanyi, Jason Grafmiller, Laura Rosseel and Freek Van de Velde. My research focused on the role of register (i.e., situational context of language use) in morphosyntactic variation in English and Dutch and I conducted corpus linguistic and psycholinguistic experiments.
