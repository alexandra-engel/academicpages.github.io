Welcome! My name is Alexandra Engel. I am a scientific librarian in training at the university library of the University of Konstanz. Before immersing myself into the world of libraries, I was a doctoral researcher at KU Leuven where I was part of the *Quantitative Variational Linguistics* research group (short: QLVL) at KU Leuven working in the field of cognitive sociolinguistics. My research focused on the role of register (i.e., situational context of language use) in morphosyntactic variation in English and Dutch and I conducted corpus linguistic and psycholinguistic experiments.
